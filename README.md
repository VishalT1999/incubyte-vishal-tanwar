# String Calculator

A simple Ruby **String Calculator** that handles a list of numbers provided as a string. It supports:
- Summing comma-separated numbers.
- Handling numbers with newlines.
- Using custom delimiters.
- Throwing exceptions for negative numbers.

## Features

- **Empty string** returns `0`.
- **Comma-separated numbers** are supported.
- **Newline-separated numbers** are supported (e.g., `"1\n2,3"` should return `6`).
- **Custom delimiters** are supported (e.g., `"//;\n1;2"`).
- **Negative numbers** are not allowed and an exception is thrown with a message containing the negative numbers.
- **Multiple negative numbers** will be included in the exception message.
